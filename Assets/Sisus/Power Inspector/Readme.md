### Power Inspector
Power Inspector is a full replacement for the default Inspector window, with [many additional features](https://docs.sisus.co/power-inspector/features/list-of-main-features/).

### Quick Start
Use the menu item *Window > Power Inspector > New Window* to open the Power Inspector Window.
You use the Power Inspector window like you would use the default Inspector: select an Object in the
Hierarchy window or the Project window, and the exposed data of the Object gets shown in the window,
for you to view and edit as you please.

### Recommended Project Settings
Disabling domain reloading when entering play mode is highly recommended to get an optimal experience when using Power Inspector.
This can be done by following these steps:
1. Select the main menu item Edit > Project Settings…
2. Select the Editor section.
3. Scroll down to the Enter Play Mode Settings section.
4. Enable Enter Play Mode Options.
5. Disable Reload Domain.
